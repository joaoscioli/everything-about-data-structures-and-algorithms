# Two Pointers

## 📌 What is it?
Two Pointers is a technique where two indices traverse a data structure
from different positions to reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

---

## 🎯 When to use
- Sorted arrays
- Problems involving pairs
- Palindrome checks
- Removing duplicates
- Partitioning problems

---

## 🧩 Common Variations
- Left & Right pointers
- Slow & Fast pointers
- Same direction traversal
- Opposite direction traversal

---

## 📈 Time & Space Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

---

## 🧪 Examples
| Example | Description |
|-------|------------|
| two_sum_sorted | Find two numbers that sum to target |
| reverse_string | Reverse a string in-place |
| remove_duplicates | Remove duplicates from sorted array |

---

## 🧠 Interview Tips
- Always check if the array is sorted
- Ask if extra space is allowed
- Be careful with pointer movement conditions
