# Everything about Data Structures & Algorithms

### by **TheCodingCabin**

This repository is part of the **Everything about X** series from **TheCodingCabin** and is dedicated to mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms** with a strong focus on **coding interviews**, **problem-solving patterns**, and **engineering-level thinking**.

The goal is not just to solve problems, but to **understand why solutions work**, recognize **recurring patterns**, and build a **solid algorithmic mindset** applicable to real-world software engineering interviews.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a **strong foundation** in Data Structures & Algorithms
* Master **coding interview patterns** (LeetCode-style problems)
* Improve **problem-solving and analytical thinking**
* Understand **time and space complexity** deeply
* Create a **structured knowledge base** for long-term reference

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a **pattern-oriented approach**, inspired by real interview processes and industry expectations.

Instead of memorizing solutions, the focus is on:

* Identifying patterns
* Breaking problems down
* Writing clean, readable, and efficient code
* Explaining the reasoning behind each solution

---
